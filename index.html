          <h4>What hobby would you get into if time and money weren’t an issue?</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>Wow! If money wasn't an issue, I would like to lots of things.  I wouldn't call this a hobby, but I would like to make a career out of shoe desgining.  Everyone needs a pair of shoes in their life.  I've been following some great designer and they have opened my eyes about designing shoes on how you want them to be.  From top deginers in LA to Italy, the sky is the limit. This is just the artistic side of me.  </p>

          <h4>What fictional place would you most like to go?</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>That's an easy question.  Hogwarts.  I know Universal Studios built Hogwarts, BUT, I've never been just yet.  I really want to go and experience the life as a wizard or witch.  I think magic is amazing.  You can do all sorts of things.  I would love to cast spells, fight off bad people, and so on. There's magic in all of us.  </p>

          <h4>What’s your favorite drink?</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>Oh gosh. My favorite drink?  Well, I have a few favorite drinks.  My favorite non-alcoholic drink is something tropical.  I love drinking 100% fruit juice.  But, if we are talking about cocktail, my go to drink is, good old Grey Goose dirty martini. Extra dirty with extra olives. YUM. </p>

          <h4>How different was your life one year ago?</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>I definitely have grown a lot.  I have done some things that I'm not proud of.  From then, I think I've become a better and stronger person.  I believe people do learn from their mistakes and people should get second chances.  People can do horrible things in life and should learn not to make the same mistake. So, I've grown to be a better person.</p>
